Generic Configuration
---------------------

Everytime I install a new Linux machine there are config files that need to be
edited. For example, on a server it's a good idea to disable remote root login
after an administrator account is being created. Another example is a desktop
host which needs a firewall for security purpose, but with much simpler rules
than a router firewall.

This project aims to give a quick technical overview of the config files I need
to modify and how there are set up. Hence it is organised in folders sorted by
domain. Each folders contains a set of files with comments and sometimes a
README file.
