Build a development environment for Debian
------------------------------------------

Compile a Debian package in debug mode
--------------------------------------

Sometimes there is a debug package for the package "foo" you want. In such case,
this package is named "foo-dbg" or something like that.

If such package doesn't exist, you need to recompile the package by adding some
options to debuild. This can be done in a clean temporary directory by issuing
the following commands:

    sudo apt-get build foo
    apt-get source foo
    cd foo-*/
    export DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS="nostrip noopt"
    debuild -uc -us
    sudo dpkg -i ../foo_*.deb

Theses commands first install all the necessary build dependency and extract
the Debian-patched version of "foo" in a "foo-version" directory. Running
"debuild" into this directory is enough to build a "foo_version_arch.deb" file
in the main folder, the options are here to tweak the compiling process
(disable stripping symbols from executable files and disable optimization) and
the build process (don't sign any produced files). Instead of calling debuild,
calling "dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot" may work, as some document says.

All of this allow (for compiled code) to display source code in gdb, and to
follow program execution with "layout src" and "layout split", instead of
"layout regs" and "layout asm"


Set up your own Debian repository
---------------------------------

You may want to install some package you compiled in several systems or to make
this package publicly available. This can be achieved thanks to reprepro, which
is a simple tool to maintain a repository tree. To do that, let's assume you
want a package tree in /var/packages/debian.

First, create /var/packages/debian/conf/distributions with something like:
    Origin: My Repository
    Label:  My Repository
    Suite: unstable
    Codename: sid
    Architectures: i386 amd64 source
    Components: main
    Description: My APT repositories
    DebOverride: override.sid
    DscOverride: override.sid
    SignWith: 12345678

(SignWith is an optional line which identifies a PGP key which is used to sign
the package tree)

Then create /var/packages/debian/conf/options:
    verbose
    ask-passphrase
    basedir /var/packages/debian

And create /var/packages/debian/conf/override.sid, which can be empty, but may
also contains lines which override package descriptions such as:
    my-package Priority optional
    my-package Section net

Then you can add .deb files with:
    reprepro includedeb sid /path/to/mypackage.deb

and source, changes and deb files all at once with:
    reprepro include sid /path/to/mypackage.dsc

To serve this repo with a web server, you may want to exclude conf/ and db/
directories from direct browsing to protect your specific configuration.

Finally, you need to add at least the first line in the /etc/apt/sources.list
of your hosts which use this new APT repository:
    deb http://my-host.tld/debian sid main
    deb-src http://my-host.tld/debian sid main
And also use "apt-key add" to add the GPG public key of the repository to your
GPG keychain.
