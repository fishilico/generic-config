# You do need to talk to an NTP server or two (or three).
#server ntp.your-provider.example

# pool.ntp.org maps to about 1000 low-stratum NTP servers.  Your server will
# pick a different set every time it starts up.  Please consider joining the
# pool: <http://www.pool.ntp.org/join.html>
#
# You may change these names with your distribution (*.debian.pool.ntp.org) or
# your country (*.fr.pool.ntp.org)

# Access control configuration
# The web page <http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Support/AccessRestrictions>
# might be helpful.
#
# Note that "restrict" applies to both servers and clients, so a configuration
# that might be intended to block requests from certain clients could also end
# up blocking replies from your own upstream servers.

# By default, exchange time with everybody, but don't allow configuration.
